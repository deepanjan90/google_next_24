## SUMMARY

Sarah Ford, a Developer Relations Engineer at Google, presents "Accelerate your AI with Serverless," focusing on Google Cloud's Cloud Run for backend code and incorporating AI workloads on serverless.

## IDEAS:

- Serverless allows developers to focus on application development without managing scaling.
- Cloud Run enables running any container on demand without infrastructure management.
- Traffic scaling is unpredictable, making manual scaling inefficient and costly.
- Cloud Run automatically scales based on incoming traffic and CPU utilization.
- Minimum instances feature improves latency by keeping a given number of instances ready.
- Pay-per-request billing model ensures charges only when the instance handles requests.
- Cloud Run's build packs create containers from source code without needing a Docker file.
- Application Default Credentials (ADC) simplifies authentication to Google APIs.
- Function calling in Gemini allows access to real-time data for more accurate responses.
- Cloud Run jobs process tasks to completion without maintaining a server.
- Video Intelligence API detects scene changes in videos for processing.
- FFMpeg produces screenshots for each scene change timestamp.
- Direct API calls to Vertex AI for tasks without a client library available.
- Using Cloud Run for AI workloads offers scalability and cost efficiency.
- Authentication handled by Google client libraries streamlines connecting to Google APIs.
- Cloud Run's auto-scaling eliminates the need for over-provisioning resources.
- Function calling enables LLMs to provide current information, enhancing user experience.
- Cloud Run jobs offer a solution for batch processing tasks in the cloud.
- Visual captioning of video scenes demonstrates the versatility of Cloud Run for AI tasks.
