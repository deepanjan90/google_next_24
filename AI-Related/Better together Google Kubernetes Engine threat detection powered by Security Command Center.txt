## SUMMARY

Daniel Ladu and Craig Ingram present "Better Together: GKE Threat Detection Powered by Security Command Center" at Ops 215, discussing the integration of GKE threat detection with Google Cloud's Security Command Center to enhance container security.

## IDEAS:

- GKE threat detection integrates with Security Command Center for enhanced security.
- Kubernetes celebrates its 10-year anniversary with significant contributions.
- Automated tools allow attackers to exploit Kubernetes at scale.
- Financially motivated attackers target Kubernetes for cryptocurrency mining.
- Expertise in Kubernetes and container security remains scarce, posing challenges.
- Misconfigurations in Kubernetes clusters can expose them to internet threats.
- GKE provides runtime vulnerability scanning for containers in production.
- GKE's integrated policy solution helps transition from reactive to proactive security.
- GKE compliance assesses clusters against the CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes.
- Event-based threat detection in GKE is powered by logging, requiring no additional installs.
- GKE threat detection surfaces threats in both Security Command Center and GKA Security Posture.
- Attackers use exposed clusters and misconfigurations to establish persistent access.
- Attackers clean up tracks to avoid detection after exploiting Kubernetes clusters.
- GKE threat detection uses the MITRE ATT&CK framework to categorize threats.
- Real-world attacker behaviors targeting Kubernetes inform GKE threat detection rules.
- GKE Enterprise includes a suite of security tools, including threat detection.
- Enabling GKE threat detection is a simple process, requiring no cluster installations.
- GKE's security posture tool set plans to support multi-cloud strategies.
- Custom threat detection rules are not currently supported, but feedback is noted.
- Data residency features are being developed for Security Command Center to meet regional needs.
- GKE threat detection aims to make Kubernetes security accessible without deep expertise.

## INSIGHTS:

- Kubernetes' growth and contributions highlight its central role in modern container management.
